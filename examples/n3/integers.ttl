# This example shows how to tag a literal as an integer, which is
# required for operating on it in CWM using the predicates in its math package.
#
# In RDF, typed literal values comprise a string (the lexical form of
# the literal) and a datatype (identified by a URI). The datatype is
# supposed to denote a mapping from lexical forms to some space of
#  values, like integers, reals or booleans.
